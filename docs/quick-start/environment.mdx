description: How to set up your development environment for Scaffold Stark-2.
---

# Environment

Now that our installation is complete, let's configure the development environment for Scaffold Stark-2.

### 1. **Initialize a Local Blockchain**:

Run a local network in the first terminal.

**Note:** You can skip this step if you want to use Sepolia Testnet.

```bash
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Starknet network using Devnet. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development.

### 2. On a second terminal, deploy the sample contract:

```
yarn deploy --network {NETWORK_NAME} // when NETWORK_NAME is not specified, it defaults to "devnet"
```

**Note:** To use sepolia tesnet, you have to set {NETWORK_NAME} to `sepolia`.

This command deploys a sample smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/snfoundry/src` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/snfoundry/scripts_js/deploy.js` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

### 3. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`.
