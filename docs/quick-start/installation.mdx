# Installation

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Install scarb

To ensure the proper functioning of scaffold-stark, your local `Scarb` version must be `2.5.4`. To accomplish this, first check your local Scarb version:

```sh
scarb --version
```
If your local Scarb version is not `2.5.4`, you need to install it.

## Installation Process

To install Scarb, please refer to the [installation instructions](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download).
We strongly recommend that you install
Scarb via [asdf](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-asdf), a CLI tool that can manage
multiple language runtime versions on a per-project basis.
This will ensure that the version of Scarb you use to work on a project always matches the one defined in the
project settings, avoiding problems related to version mismatches.

Please refer to the [asdf documentation](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) to install all
prerequisites.

Once you have `asdf` installed locally, you can download Scarb plugin with the following command:

```bash
asdf plugin add scarb
```

This will allow you to download specific versions. You can choose the same version as the Dojo's Cairo version, for example, 2.5.4, with the following command:

```bash
asdf install scarb 2.5.4
```

and set a global version:

```bash
asdf global scarb 2.5.4
```

Otherwise, you can simply run the following command in your terminal, and follow the onscreen instructions. This
will install the version `2.5.4` of Scarb.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh -s -- -v 2.5.4
```
